Hi. My name is Isaac Goodman. I have been interested in technology ever since
I learned that computers had languages.

In my blog, I hope to soon be providing usefull knowledge about technology,
which could be a good resource for tech help.

My brother has a website, too. His website is about miniature painting and
can be found <a link href="www.samsminiaturepainting.com">here</a>. To 
contact him through my website, email him
<a link href="mailto:samthetutor@samsminiaturepainting.com">here</a>.
